<h1>Find Words Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">Find Words</span> will help you find words to play in
	the game of Scrabble, Wordle, or help with crossword puzzles.
	You enter letters of the tiles you have in your hand (but see
	<span class="quote">Available letters</span>).  Optionally, you can enter
	a letter or letters on the board that the suggested word must contain.  You can 
	also enter the letters the suggested word must start with and end with.
</p>
<p>
	Four dictionaries are supported: The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, or OSPD;
	the Official Tournament and Club Word List, or TWL; and COLLINS (formerly called
	SOWPODS), which is used in most countries outside the USA, and COLLINS_DEFINE,
	which is the Collins dictionary with definitions.  The WORDS dictionary is designed
	to work in crossword mode.  It's the standard Linux "words" dictionary without any
	entries that have an apostrophe in them.
</p>
<p>
	If you are familiar with regular expressions you can use them in
	<span class="quote">Contains letters</span> to limit your search.
</p>
<p>
	A list of suggested words is displayed when you press <span class="button">
	Submit</span> or press the <span class="key">Enter</span> key.  All entered data
	is cleared when the <span class="button">Clear</span> button is pressed.
	The suggested words are displayed first by highest value first and then if the
	values are the same, by alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="emphasis">Find Words</span> has a limited ability to detect
	whether a word is a bingo (with an extra 50 points).  Specifically, it may fail
	to catch bingos if <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> contains certain
	regular expressions.  This means it is possible (but not
	likely) that a bingo word may not display first in the suggested wordlist.
</p>

<h2>Type Of Game</h2>
<p>
	Select the type of game you would like words suggested for.  Selecting
	<span class="quote">Crossword</span> disables
	the "two dots only" check in the <span class="quote">Available Letters</span> and enables a
	new field, <span class="quote">Number of Letters</span>.  You may also want to use the WORDS
	dictionary because it contains names, but any of them will work.  Selecting
	Wordle sets the <span class="quote">Number of Letters</span> to 5 and changes
	<span class="quote">Available Letters</span> to <span class="quote">Can't Have Letters</span>
	(see below).
</p>

<h2>Available Letters/Can't Have Letters</h2>
<p>
	Enter the letters of the tiles in your hand.  If you have blank tiles, enter these as
	dots (.).  If the type of game is Wordle, this becomes
	<span class="quote"> Can't Have Letters</span> entry.  With this type of game, the available
	letters are determined by removing the letters from a complete alphabet.
</p>

<h2>Contains Letters</h2>
<p>	
	Enter letters on the board that the suggested word will intersect.  
	Regular expressions are allowed.  For instance, if you know you want a letter "a"
	as the third letter, enter "^..a".
	The regex will be tested to make sure it is a valid regular expression.  Note
	that if you use "^", any letters in the <span class="quote">Starts With</span>
	field are illegal, and if you use "$", any letters in the
	<span class="quote">Ends With</span> field are illegal.
</p>
<p>
	You may also use commas to separate the letters.  Here's how it works:  If you enter
	letters into <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span> without commas, then 
	<span class="emphasis">Find Words</span> will search for that exact pattern.  But if
	you enter letters separated by commas, then all the letters must in the word in any
	position.  For instance, if you enter the letters "ore" into <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>,
	then you get words that have those letters in the same place, for instance, "store", but not
	"reorder".  But if you enter "o,r,e", then the word "reorder" would be found since it has
	each one of those letters.
</p>

<h2>Starts With</h2>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should start with. 
</p>

<h2>Ends With</h2>
<p>
	Enter the letter or letters the suggested words should end with. 
</p>

<h2>Use of Capital Letters</h2>
<p>
	The <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>, <span class="quote">Starts With</span>,
	and <span class="quote">Ends With</span> fields will all take capital
	letters.  These have a special meaning, best illustrated by an example.  
</p>
<p>
	Say there is a letter on the board, "m", and you know you want to take a letter from
	your hand, "a", to make a word that contains "ma".  You could remove the "a" from your
	<span class="quote">Available Letters</span> field and enter "ma" in the <span class="quote">
	Contains Letters</span> field.  However, you now have to remember to put back the "a"
	if you look for another list of words with different settings.
</p>
<p>
	The shortcut for this is to use capital letters in the <span class="quote">
	Contains Letters</span>, <span class="quote">Starts With</span>, or <span class="quote">
	Ends With</span> fields.  Entering "mA" in the <span class="quote">Contains Letters</span>
	field means, I want to see a list of all words that contain "ma", but first remove one
	"a" from the <span class="quote">Available Letters</span> field.
</p>

<h2>Dictionary</h2>
<p>
	Select the dictionary to use.  The default is COLLINS.  Selecting the COLLINS_DEFINE
	dictionary will display definitions after the suggested word and score.  WORDS is the only
	dictionary that contains names, therefore it is not suitable for Scrabble and Wordle.
</p>

<h2>Number of Letters</h2>
<p>
	This field holds the exact number of letters the suggested words should
	contain.  Its value can be 0 - 20, or blank, which is the same as zero.  Zero or blank
	mean no restriction is applied.  If the <span class="quote">Type of Game</span> is
	Wordle, the length is set to 5.
